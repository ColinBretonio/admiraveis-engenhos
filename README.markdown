## Desiderata

I need to host [a documentation project](http://admiraveis-engenhos.surge.sh/) developed with [Urubu](http://urubu-quickstart.jandecaluwe.com/deploy.html), whose deploy instructions are a little vague.

I would like it to be a personal or group URL with sub-projects under it serving as portfolio items.

And I want to use this README as a notepad for keeping track of [current projects](http://bretonio.gitlab.io/gringolalia/page/projetos/).

Which platforms do I want to theme for, for example? The ones with the best docs and tutorials and the simplest workflow. 

Mostly [Python-programmed](https://www.fullstackpython.com/static-site-generator.html), I find. Node.js and Ruby have been cruel to me at times.
